            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Fiftly, Chriſt is a moſt happie Phiſition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe none of his patients did euer periſh in their ſickeneſſe,

               <p>And as in loue he hath deliuered vs from the greateſt euill, and hath diſcharged vs of the worſt debt; ſo alſo in his incomprehenſible fauour, he hath beſtowed vpon vs the greateſt good, and furniſhed to vs the moſt pretious and durable riches.</p>
               <p>When as <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> had of his owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord payed the debt of a Senator his fauorite,

                  <hi>He will receiue from him a kingdome which cannot be ſhaken, but remaineth with vs for euer.</hi> So we may ſay,
<note n="k" place="margin">Col. 3.11.</note> 
                  <hi>Chriſtus nobis omnia &amp; in omnibus,</hi> Chriſt is all to vs, and in all things.</p>
               <p>This was a true ſignification of the loue of <hi>Euilmerodach</hi> King of Babel, toward <hi>Iehoiachin</hi> King of Iudah, for that
<note n="l" place="margin">Ier. 52.31.</note> 
                  <hi>he lifted vp his head and brought him out of priſon, he ſpake kindly to him, and changed his priſon garments; he ſet his throne aboue the throne of his Princes that were with him in Babel, and he did giue him a continuall por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion all the dayes of his life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſt hath giuen a more ſure demonſtration of his loue towards vs, who brings vs forth from a filthy priſon, who ſpeakes peaceably and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably to our conſciences, who changeth our priſon, rent and polluted garments, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoweth vpon vs
<note n="m" place="margin">Ioh. 16.13.</note> 
                  <hi>the Spirit of truth which will leade vs in all truth, and
<note n="n" place="margin">Reu. 3.21.</note> who will grant to vs, that we ſhall ſit with Him, and with his Father in his throne, to praiſe and bleſſe his glorious name for euer and euer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the Loue of Chriſt, may be very mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt and well knowne to vs, by his awaiting for vs, who are lingring; by his ſeeking of vs, when we are wandring; by his taking paines for vs, who were fleeing and departing from him; by fighting for vs, for our Redemption; by ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:13430:38"/>vs who are infirme and weake; by forgiuing vs great debts, by beſtowing vpon vs great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits.</p>

               <p>If a couetous or auaricious worme, would promiſe vs great benefite, we might haue cauſe to doubt of the performance of that promiſe, feeing it is contrary to his nature to be liberall or beneficiall.</p>
               <p>But Chriſt when he promiſeth good things, we may be certainly perſwaded that in due time he will accompliſh and fulfill what euer he hath promiſed; for <hi>he doth

               <p>Ninthly, The Loue of Chriſt,

               <p>Thus we ſee that there is a foure-fold power or facultie, in well diſpoſed and holeſome bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: 1. A drawing power to receiue meate: 2.

               <p>Secondly, Chriſt will inrich thoſe who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment their pouertie after they haue ſeene it, and make their moane to Chriſt, becauſe they haue no furniture, nor goodneſſe in them, for the mainteinance of their Spirituall life, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging themſelues to bee beggers and banke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts, their eſtate being diſtreſſed and vndone; that in regard of grace and Gods fauour, they are ſo poore by nature, ſo that they haue no good thing at all, more then they get by beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging.</p>
               <p>The knowledge and feeling of our miſerable ſpirituall pouertie,

               <p>

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:13430:104"/>the Iſraelites complained, that <hi>Solomons

               <p>Thirdly,

<note place="margin">Captiuitie of ſinners vnder Satan</note> of the bondage and thraldome, wherein hee holdeth his miſerable ſlaues. The bondage of the Iſraelites in Egypt vnder <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> was euill: the bondage in Babylon was worſe: but the bondage vnder the Diuell by infinite degrees is

<note n="g" place="margin">Exod. 2.23.</note>

<note n="h" place="margin">Pſa. 137.1.</note> 
                  <hi>by the Riuers of Babel they wept</hi> before the Lord, they were exceeding weary of their thraldome and captiuitie: But Satan deteineth both body and ſoule in captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and filthineſſe, ſo that

               <p>Furthermore, captiues to earthly Tyrants,
<note place="margin">They are in ſnares and priſon.</note> are not euer deteined in pits, and ſnares: but
<note n="l" place="margin">Iſa. 24.17.</note> 
                  <hi>feare and the pit, and the ſnare, are vpon the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:13430:105"/>of the Earth,</hi> who are not deliuered by Chriſt; They are all taken

                  <hi>in Satans ſnare,</hi> to doe his will: who receiued not libertie in Chriſt, they remaine continually in the Diuels pit, in great woe and miſerie.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> did to <hi>Zedechiah</hi> bodily, ſo Satan doeth worſe to all his captiues ſpiritually.
<note n="n" place="margin">Iere. 39.7.</note> 
                  <hi>He put out his eyes, and bound him in chaines to carry him to Babel;</hi> The diuell puts out the eyes of the vnderſtanding, he bindeth ſinners in chaines, to carry them to Hell, and to euerlaſting tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>

               <p n="3">III. After the comfortable victorie, and our happie deliuerie, when we are in Chriſts owne poſſeſſion, he moſt franckly manumitteth vs, and giue vs true libertie, not that we may frame our life according to our naturall and filthy will, or to

                  <hi>worſhip him,</hi> in ſpirit, in truth, and ſinceritie, as he requireth of vs.</p>
               <p n="6">IV. That exchange made betwixt Chriſt and vs, is either a cauſe, or a teſtimony of our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, that He, the ſubſtantiall

                  <hi>Word was made Fleſh,</hi> and tooke vpon him our nature,

                  <hi>euen the forme of a ſeruant,</hi> to the end that
<note n="h" place="margin">2. Pet. 1.4.</note> 
                  <hi>we ſhould be partakers of the godly nature; Chriſt

Thus we may be well aſſured of our libertie by ſo many waies acquired to vs, as by ranſome, deliuerance, manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and exchange, not of perſon, but of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">From what we are free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> Chriſt giueth vs libertie, from the ceremoniall Law, and the rites of <hi>Moſes.</hi> 2. from the dominion of Sinne. 3. from the curſe of the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:13430:107"/>Law. 4. from the crueltie and tyrannie of Satan.</p>
               <p>Theſe ceremonies, as <hi>Peter</hi> confeſſeth, were a

               <p n="2">2. When we are made free by Chriſt,
<note n="o" place="margin">Rom. 6.14.</note> 
                  <hi>Sinne ſhall not haue dominion ouer vs, for he

It is anſwered, That they may agree well together: for Gods vnſpeakeable loue to Chriſt, could not ſtay his iuſtice whereby he pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth the ſinnes of the world, in the perſon of his beloued Sonne, <hi>and

               <p>Againe, if it be asked; If we be deliuered from the puniſhment of ſinne, and from the curſe of the Law; wherefore are we not alſo ſaued from the firſt death, <hi>which

               <p>The aſſurance of this made the Apoſtle

                  <hi>to deſire to be looſed, and to be with Chriſt which is beſt of all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. We are freed by Chriſt from the tyrannie of Satan, who is more falſe to vs then <hi>Zebul</hi> was to <hi>Baal,</hi> hauing deceiued him, ſaying, that his enemies, that were comming to fight againſt him, were

                  <hi>they are cruell and will haue no compaſsion,</hi> their commandements are more cruell then <hi>Pharaohs:</hi> he commanded the Iewes

                  <hi>to deſtroy euery man childe;</hi> Satan commands euery one of his ſlaues to deſtroy their ſoules. We reade that <hi>Abraham</hi> had a ſpeciall care to deliuer <hi>Lot,</hi> who in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow of <hi>Sodome</hi> was taken priſoner by <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorlaomer,
<note n="f" place="margin">Gen. 14.15.</note> he brought him againe, and recouered all his ſubſtance:</hi> Chriſt hath greater care to

<note n="g" place="margin">Pſal. 86.17.</note> 
                  <hi>will ſhew a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of his goodneſſe towards vs, that all they that hate vs may ſee it and be aſhamed, becauſe he hath holpen and comforted vs, and our

               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, touching the eſtimation that wee ought to make of this bleſſed freedome; ſurely, we haue good cauſe to account of it highly. For if <hi>Lyſias</hi> eſteemed much of the freedome of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> ſo that
<note n="i" place="margin">Act. 22.28.</note> 
                  <hi>with a great ſumme of money, he obtained it;</hi> we ſhould thinke more of the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>The priuiledges of the <hi>Romanes</hi> were chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foure: 1. They might not be iudged by any forreine Iudge, but by one of their owne nation: 2.

                     <hi>Teſte. Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio. in Act. cap.</hi> 22.</note> It was not lawfull to ſcourge or torment them. 3.

They had free acceſſe to the moſt ample honours and preferments, with ſundry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther priuiledges.</p>
               <p>But the prerogatiues of Chriſtians, are of much more worth and value.
<note n="k" place="margin">Rom. 8.33.</note> 
                  <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods choſen? it is God that iuſtifieth; who ſhall iudge them whom Chriſt abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth? who

               </p>
               <p n="3">III. The children of Chriſtian parents are happie, for they being comprehended within the compaſſe of the Couenant of God,

                  <hi>faſt in the libertie wherewith Chriſt hath made vs free, and not to be intangled againe with the yoke of bondage?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wee reade alſo what <hi>Diogenes</hi> ſaid to <hi>Craterus</hi> one of <hi>Alexanders</hi> chiefe Captaines,

               <p>This libertie ſhould be the more regarded of vs, becauſe the Lord onely can giue it vnto vs, ſo that we may truely ſay, <hi>The

               <p>IEsvs <hi>Chriſt
<note n="o" place="margin">2. Pet. 1.17.</note> who receiued of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther honour and glory, he will
<note n="p" place="margin">Rom. 15.7.</note> receiue vs alſo to the glory of God.</hi> As hee vouchſafeth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs true and happie libertie; ſo hee will
<note n="r" place="margin">Hebr. 2.7.</note> 
                  <hi>crowne vs with honour and glory, and ſet vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houe the worke of his hands, ſo that</hi>

                  <hi>we ſhall haue a Crowne of glory, and a royall Diadem in the hand of our Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching this benefit, in handling thereof, wee will conſider theſe ſeuen points. 1. That Chriſt will deliuer vs from ſhame and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. 2. That hee will remooue contempt and
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:13430:111"/>diſgrace. 3. That he giueth true honour. 4. Of the certainetie thereof. 5. Of the continuance thereof. 6. To whom it ſhall bee giuen, and where chiefely. 7. Of the vſes of this gift.</p>
               <p>Chriſt deliuereth his owne from ſhame.
<note n="1" place="margin">Chriſt deliuereth, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhame.</note> For if hee

               <p>Men naturally and vſually are aſhamed: Firſt, when they are tryed to bee ignorant, eſpecially profeſſing knowledge: Secondly, when they are diſappointed in thoſe in whom they moſt tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted: Thirdly, when they are deprehended in an vniuſt and vnlawfull fact: Fourthly, when they are manifeſtly conuicted of ingratitude: Fiftly, when publikely they are puniſhed: Sixtly, when they ſee themſelues filthie and naked.</p>
               <p>Men are aſhamed of ignorance:

Will not the ſhame of ſinners who haue no part in Chriſt, bee exceeding great, being conuicted of worſe ignorance then is in beaſtes? 2. When they are fruſtrated, and diſappointed of their hopes and expectations.

                  <hi>and mocked him,</hi> But Chriſt is moſt honoured and glorious in himſelfe, and in euery one of his clect in particular;
<note n="f" place="margin">1. Ioh. 3.2.</note> 
                  <hi>and we know that when He ſhall appeare, we ſhall be like Him:</hi> Euery Chriſtian in ſome reſpect may be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared to <hi>Brutus</hi> the firſt. <hi>Nemo primum Bruto contemptior Romae fuit,

               <p>Thirdly, Chriſt giueth honour to his own: for as
<note n="g" place="margin">Iob 5.6.</note> 
                  <hi>miſerie commeth not forth of the duſt, neither doeth affliction ſpring out of the earth,</hi> neither doth ſhame come by accident; ſo alſo

               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, touching the certaintie of this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, we may be perſwaded of it; for the
<note n="p" place="margin">Ren. 7.10.</note> 
                  <hi>holy and true God both</hi> promiſed the ſame;
<note n="q" place="margin">Ioh. 14.6.</note> 
                  <hi>He who is the Way, the Truth, and Life, will giue it;
<note n="r" place="margin">1. Cor. 1.20.</note> and the promiſes of God in him, are yea,</hi> and Amen: He is alſo moſt powerfull, moſt conſtant, and mindfull of his owne; no vntruth, no weakneſſe, no vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancie,
<note n="o" place="margin">1. Cor. 6.2.</note>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:13430:113"/>no forgetfulneſſe, nor obliuion is in him: wherefore we may be firmely aſſured, that whatſoeuer he promiſeth, that perfectly hee will accompliſh, who will giue vnto vs honour and dignitie,
<note n="ſ" place="margin">Phil. 3.21.</note> 
                  <hi>who will change our vile bodies, that they may be faſhioned like vnto his glorious bodie,</hi> according to the working whereby <hi>he is able euen to ſubdue</hi> all things to himſelfe.</p>
               <p>And albeit the godly in this preſent life, attaine not to that hight of honour, which is prepared for them: yet let them be content, becauſe Chriſt hath promiſed the ſame, expecting patiently the time appointed by his wiſedome for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of that promiſe.</p>
               <p>It is recorded, that <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great,
<note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> when he had paſſed ouer to <hi>Lybia</hi> againſt <hi>Domitius,</hi> and hauing vanquiſhed the enemie in a great battell, his ſouldiers ſaluted and honoured him with the ſtyle of an Emperour: but he denied to accept of that honour, as long as the Campe of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie did remaine in his ſight not demoliſhed.</p>
               <p>May not we be more willing to want the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our honour as long as our enemy Sinne is within vs? as long as
<note n="t" place="margin">Rom. 7.23.</note> 
                  <hi>we ſee another law in our members rebelling againſt the law of our minds,</hi> and leading vs captiue vnto the law of ſinne; As long
<note n="u" place="margin">Gal. 5.17.</note> 
                  <hi>as the fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit, &amp; the ſpirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the fleſh, &amp; theſe all contrary one to the other,</hi> we cannot doe the ſame things that we would.</p>
               <p>Yet we need not to feare,
<note n="x" place="margin">Luk. 12.32. The conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</note> 
                  <hi>for it is our Fathers pleaſure to poſſeſſe vs in that kingdome which hee will giue vs,</hi> in due ſeaſon, where wee ſhall
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:13430:114"/>remaine in all honour and felicitie for euer.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, albeit
<note n="a" place="margin">Pſal. 44.12.</note> 
                  <hi>man ſhall not continue in worldly honour,</hi> yet the Elect ſhal continue in the heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honour. As for worldly glory, It may bee compared to the ſmoake that commeth out of the chimney, which at the firſt appeareth to be ſomething, but ſuddenly euaniſheth in the ayre, and is not perceiued for true,
<note n="b" place="margin">Iſa. 40.6.</note> 
                  <hi>all fleſh is graſſe, all the grace and glory thereof is as the floure of the field that ſoone withereth and fadeth;</hi> which words are ſpoken of a naturall man as he is in himſelfe,

                  <hi>Nazianzen</hi> compareth earthly honour to the impreſſions or furrowes which the ſhip maketh in the Sea, they ſuddenly goe out of fight, and the place of them is not knowne.

               </p>
               <p>Among the Roman Emperours, <hi>Valerianus</hi> was taken priſoner by <hi>Sapor</hi> king of the Perſians, his wealth turned to pouertie, his honour to ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominie, and he made a foot-ſtoole to a proud Barbarian, mounting on his horſe-backe: many

               <p>Againe there is a true peace,

               <p>If therefore thou feare God, loue him, doing right in his eyes, follow peace and be Chriſt Diſciple and the Sonne of peace, peace ſhall be with thee: but all thoſe that rebell againſt the Lord, contemne his word, who are giuen to contention, who refuſe his inſtruction, <hi>God who

               <p>Fourthly, <hi>This
<note n="p" place="margin">Gal. 5.22.</note> peace is a fruit of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>

<note place="margin">The order heere ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued.</note> which is the moſt ſpeciall good, we receiue in this earth, we will ſpeake briefely of theſe particular points: 1.

               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">Beginnings of grace deſire ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</note> he who is the fountaine of grace, giueth ordinarily two beginnings of it: 1. A deſire of grace: 2. A purpoſe of amendment.</p>
               <p>This deſire of grace proceedeth from grace,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Simil. </seg>
                  </label> and it is a ſure argument that ſome grace is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy wrought, and that it is not altogether defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and lacking, where that deſire remaineth.</p>
               <p>As a ſicke man deſireth the windowes of his houſe to be opened, that he may get ayre to be refreſhed. This his deſire argueth not, that alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether he wanteth ayre, for then his life could not continue, he would incontinently be choa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, but that already he hath ſome ayre, and
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:13430:138"/>thirſteth for the ſame iuyce abundantly: ſo the deſire of grace is no token of the want of grace, but a beginning of further grace, and a ſure pledge that it will come ſhortly more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>
               <p>Yet let vs remember: Firſt, that our deſire ſhould not bee inconſtant and fleeting, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and continuing, like <hi>Dauids</hi> deſire;
<note n="ſ" place="margin">Pſal. 27.4.</note> 
                  <hi>One thing I haue deſired that I will require:</hi> Secondly, our deſire ſhould bee accompanied with an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt care to vſe lawfull meanes, whereby wee may attaine to it, like

               <p>It is the cuſtome of the reprobate to deſire and wiſh for grace and good things, but to vſe no meanes to come to it. As <hi>Balaam</hi> deſired good, and wiſhed to

               <p>As that blaſphemous and railing <hi>Rabſhakeh,</hi> by appearance ſeemed to haue ſpoken fauourably to the people of Ieruſalem, ſaying;
<note n="l" place="margin">2. King. 18.31.</note>

               <p>Like as that rauenous and crafty beaſt,

               <p>Notwithſtanding, the aduiſed and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:13430:184"/>Chriſtian knowing his hatred, ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe him, inuiting cruelly with <hi>Goliah,</hi> crying; <hi>(

<note n="n" place="margin">Prou. 7.18.</note> Come, let <hi>vs take our fill of loue, let vs take our pleaſure in dalliance:</hi> who yeeldeth to his entiſings, is as an Oxe that goeth to the ſlaughter, &amp; as a foole to the ſtockes for puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but let vs harken &amp; yeelde vnto the louing inuitation of our Sauiour offering rich mercy, &amp; exhibiting tender kindnes, whoſe calling is euer for our profite, and emolument.

<note n="o" place="margin">Pſal. 34.11.</note> 
                  <hi>Come chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, hearken vnto me, I will teach you the feare of the Lord:</hi> ſometimes for our recreation,
<note n="p" place="margin">Cant. 2.11, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>The flowers appeare in the earth, the time of ſinging of birds is come, and the voice of the Turtle is hard in our land, the figge-tree hath brought foorth her young figges, and the vines with their ſmall grapes, caſt a ſauour; ariſe my Loue, my faire one, and come thy way:</hi> ſometimes he calleth vpon vs for our nouriſhment,
<note n="q" place="margin">Iſa. 55.1.</note> 
                  <hi>Come, buy wine and milke without ſiluer and without money:</hi> ſometimes for our preferment, as it was an honour to the holy Euangeliſt Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> when the Angel ſaid,
<note n="r" place="margin">Reu. 21.9.</note> 
                  <hi>Come, I will ſhew thee the Bride the Lambs wife,</hi> ſo it will be greater honour to the true Chriſtian, when Chriſt ſaith, Come to be my Spouſe: this honourable and comfortable inuitation ſhould allure vs to yeeld willingly thereunto.</p>
               <pb n="362" facs="tcp:13430:185"/>
               <p n="4">4. The condition of the wicked who come not to Chriſt,
<note place="margin">They are miſerable that come not.</note> is very miſerable: for by not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming they depart from him, and they forſake him, they ſhall be forſaken and deſolate, hee will depart from them,
<note n="ſ" place="margin">Hoſ. 9.12.</note> 
                  <hi>and woe to them when hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth from them:</hi> for then ſeeing they enter not in at the right gate, to come to Chriſt; <hi>as
<note n="t" place="margin">Eccleſ. 2.14.</note> fooles they walke in darkeneſſe, then
<note n="u" place="margin">Gen. 29.19.</note> they walke according to the ſtubburnneſſe of their owne hearts, adding drunkenneſſe to thirſt:
<note n="x" place="margin">1. Pet. 4.3.</note> then they will walke after vanitie, and become vaine, then they ſhall walke in luſts and wantonneſſe, in gluttonie and drunkenneſſe, and in abominable idolatries, after the vngodly Gentiles, and
<note n="a" place="margin">Iud. 18.</note> after their vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly luſts and concupiſcences,</hi> vntill they be drowned in filthineſſe, and endleſſe damnation.</p>
               <p n="5">5.
<note place="margin">The exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the godly.</note> The example of the faithfull, who haue gone before vs; ſhould inuite vs alſo to goe to Chriſt:
<note n="b" place="margin">Heb. 12.1.</note> 
                  <hi>Seeing wee are compaſſed with ſo great a cloud of witneſſes,</hi> let vs runne with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, the race that is ſet before vs, looking and comming to Ieſus the authour, and finiſher of our faith; for all the godly, from the beginning of the World, who haue beene adorned with true faith and obedience, they haue gone to Chriſt before vs.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">Who come to Chriſt.</note> we will declare briefely, who doth come to Chriſt: Firſt, that perſon whom hee chuſeth;
<note n="c" place="margin">Pſal. 65.4.</note> 
                  <hi>Bleſſed is he whom thou chuſest, and cauſeſt to come to thee:</hi> Secondly, hee whom the Father giueth;
<note n="d" place="margin">Ioh. 6.37.</note> 
                  <hi>All that the Father giueth me, (ſaith our Sauiour) ſhall come to mee, and him
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:13430:185"/>that commeth to me, I caſt not away:</hi> Thirdly, <hi>who are
<note n="e" place="margin">Mat. 11.28.</note> weary and laden,</hi> hauing a ſence, and a fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of their heauie burden, Chriſt calleth on them, promiſing to eaſe them: Fourthly, <hi>whom
<note n="f" place="margin">Iohn 6.44.</note> the Father draweth:</hi> Fiftly, his owne faithfull ſeruants, his Diſciples and
<note n="g" place="margin">Iſa. 6.4.</note> 
                  <hi>children ſhall come from farre, to be nouriſhed and inſtructed.</hi> Seeing then without Gods election, his donation, his attractiue operation, without the feeling of thy burden, and his loue and compaſſion, none can come to him; let vs intreate our God to loue vs, to chuſe vs, to giue vs his onely Sonne, to grant life and light to vs, ſo that wee may addreſſe our ſelues to our Redeemer; praying with his owne Spouſe,
<note n="h" place="margin">Cant. 1.3.</note> 
                  <hi>Draw mee, and wee will runne after thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">From what they come.</note> if wee haue a purpoſe to come to Chriſt, wee muſt leaue and forſake the World, Sinne, Satan, and our carnall pleaſures.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Wee muſt come from the World,
<note place="margin">From the World.</note> which is a matter of much difficultie; for then our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie will ſhew vs the Kingdomes,
<note n="i" place="margin">Mat. 4.8.</note> 
                  <hi>and the glory thereof;</hi> yet if wee looke narrowly thereto, wee ſhall ſubſcribe vnto the ſaying of the Antient, <hi>Mundus ecce nutat &amp; labitur, &amp; riuinam ſui,
<note place="margin">Cyprian. lib. de moral.</note> non tam ſenectu te rerum, quam fine teſtatur.</hi> Behold the World is tottering and failing, and doeth witneſſe the decay thereof, not ſo much by the old age of things, as by the end; therein is the

                  <hi>luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eyes, and pride of life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A man would willingly remooue, and flee out
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:13430:186"/>of a ruinous, and rotten houſe: A Chriſtian ſhould more gladly remooue, in his heart, affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and determinations, from this rotten and ruinous World. As a noble and wealthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage, hath no pleaſure nor contentment, to remaine long within a coole trench vnder the earth, for there is narrowneſſe, filthineſſe, darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and danger, that place is not ample, but ſtraight; not cleane, but defiling; there is little but darkeneſſe and perill:
<label type="milestone">

                  </label> So a Chriſtian ſhould haue ſmall ioy or contentment, to remaine long in this earth. If the children of <hi>Dan,</hi> eſteemed that place where they dwelt to bee too little for them, and reſolued to leaue it, and to goe to Laiſh,

                  <hi>where are many dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling places;</hi> Chriſt reigneth, who will grant to the godly,

                  <hi>that they may ſit with him in his throne,</hi> to be bleſſed for euer.</p>
